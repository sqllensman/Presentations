-- The "right" ways to tune a query
-- (a) Look at elapsed time and CPU time (warning: fluctuations in overall server pressure can affect this!)
-- (b) Look at logical reads (warning: sometimes incomplete; not relevant if query is not I/O bound)
-- But ... what if the query takes four hours to run?
