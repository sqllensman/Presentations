/*
During the following steps work was being performed on the database.
5:50PM a full backup was performed.
5:51PM transaction log backup.
5:52PM transaction log backup.
5:53PM transaction log backup.
5:54PM transaction log backup.
5:55PM transaction log backup.
5:56PM transaction log backup.
Around 5:57PM to 5:58pm data from the [OPEN_NFIRS].[Record1000]  users reported the table was no longer able to be queried, red error messages when selecting from [OPEN_NFIRS].[Record1000]. Soon thereafter that the data in the table was missing. Someone noticed that the table was empty, then turned off transaction log backups, and put the database in single user mode to prevent any more changes.
Around 5:59PM the database was detached, and the MDF, LDF, and NDF files were copied off.
Your goal if you choose to accept it is to get restore all the data in the [OPEN_NFIRS].[Record1000] table prior to its disappearance. 
Note: there may have been multiple DBA’s working on this system in several different time zones across the world.
